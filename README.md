# Simple LED Switch Circuit - KiCad Project

This is a basic KiCad project that demonstrates a simple circuit with a switch controlling an LED. Created by Jake Wanre from Coolum High School.

## Circuit Description

The circuit consists of:
- 1x Push button switch
- 1x LED
- 1x 220Î© current-limiting resistor
- Power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections

When the push button is pressed, the LED will light up.

## Requirements

- KiCad 7.0 or later

## How to Open the Project

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakewanre/light-circuit.git
```

2. Open KiCad
3. Go to File -> Open Project
4. Navigate to the cloned repository folder
5. Select `switch_light.kicad_pro`

## Files Included

- `switch_light.sch` - The schematic file containing the circuit design
- `switch_light.kicad_pro` - The KiCad project file
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Circuit Preview

The circuit is a basic demonstration of:
- Digital input (push button switch)
- Digital output (LED)
- Current limiting (resistor)
- Power distribution
